Questions for John et al:

[ ] should _all_ APInt operators inherit poison values from their APInt
operands, or just ones designated in the LLVM Intemediate Lang spec as
capable of generating poison values?

[ ] possibility of other bugs in APInt: example: APInt.cpp, method
	initSlowCase( unsigned, uint64_t, bool): argument numBits is unused.
